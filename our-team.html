                  <p>Chris has been fascinated by astronomy since he was 6 years old and his dad kept him up late to see Halley's comet through binoculars. That began a lifelong love of being under starry skies and imagining the possibilities of other worlds. In 2012 he started an obsession with astrophotography and as well as enjoying being able to shoot the stars from home in Martinborough, continues to travel to remote places in search of the perfect night landscape. Chris has been a stargazing tour guide for Dark Sky Project in Lake Tekapo and their team leader for astrophotography. He has recently moved back to his home region to take advantage of the amazing night skies around the Wairarapa.</p>

She has a BSc in Astronomy from University of Canterbury and is a very knowledgeable guide.</p>
